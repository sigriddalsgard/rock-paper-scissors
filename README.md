Player 1 chooses a number (1 = rock, 2 = paper, 3 = scissors), and is given a nonce and a hash.
Player 1 sends the hash to Player 2.

Player 2 does the same, and sends the hash to Player 1.
Now when both players has their opponents hash, they share their choice and nonce.

Both players can now verify if the opponent is trustworthy or not.
